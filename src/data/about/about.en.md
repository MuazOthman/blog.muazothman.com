title: "About"
---

I’m a **Staff Engineer at Cypress.io**, where I contribute to developer tooling and engineering leadership. Previously, I spent years leading teams and delivering SaaS products at **Azavar Technologies**, working at the intersection of **engineering leadership, architecture, and hands-on coding**. Before that, I worked with several small teams and even a solo developer to build small applications.

Alongside industry roles, I’ve taught computer science courses at multiple universities at undergraduate and graduate level, sharing knowledge on databases, programming, and advanced software engineering.

I hold an MSc in **Computer Science** (DePaul University) and an MSc in **Software Engineering** (Damascus University), where my research explored cross-platform mobile application development.

## What I’ve Built

- **Cypress Cloud & Cypress App** — contributed to building and scaling many core features and capabilities that power the developer experience for one of the most widely adopted end-to-end testing frameworks.
- **Localgov** — an e-commerce platform for local governments to collect taxes and fees.
- **Streamlined Sales Tax Registration System (SSTRS)** — a platform serving businesses, states, and tax providers for multi-state registration.
- Multiple **cloud-native SaaS products**, transforming legacy platforms into scalable, modern web systems.

## My Approach

- **Architecture with pragmatism**: balancing design elegance with business realities.
- **Team growth**: fostering engineering culture, mentorship, and cross-timezone collaboration.
- **Adaptability**: diving into new technologies quickly, then making them approachable for teams.

## Beyond Work

When I’m not building software, I enjoy exploring ideas that connect technology, education, and society — and writing about what I learn along the way.
